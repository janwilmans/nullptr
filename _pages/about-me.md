Hi there dear reader,

I'm Jan Wilmans, software architect and coach.

I like to explain c++ to others without teaching them perse. I believe its better to *mentor* people instead of teaching them. [Here][1] is a short post on the difference. On this website I have collected several projects that have my interest and there is a blog where I sometimes rant about c++.

If you would like to thank me for the Open Source work I do, please donate by buying me a [Ko-Fi][2] or send me a [donation on PayPal][3]. Your contribution is greatly appreciated and will encourage me to continue writing and developing.

If you want to contact me, you can find me on twitter [@janwilmans][4] or email me directly using my name and adding @gmail.com
