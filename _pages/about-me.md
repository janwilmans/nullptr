I'm Jan Wilmans, a software engineer. I like to explain c++ to others without teaching them perse. I believe its better to *mentor* people instead of teaching them. On this website I have collected several projects that have my interest and there is a blog where a rant about c++.

If you want to thank me for the Open Source work I do, please donate by buying me a [Ko-Fi][1] or send me a [donation on PayPal][2].
