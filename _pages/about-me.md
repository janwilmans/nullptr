Hi there dear reader,

I'm Jan Wilmans, software architect and coach.

I like to help people, demystify C++, but without teaching them perse. I believe its better to *mentor* or *coach* people instead of teaching them. [Here][1] is a short post on the difference. I'm also a [Coach][2] on [codingcoach.io][3], feel free to contact me if you have questions to would like to have a techy chat :)

On this website I have collected several projects that have my interest and there is a blog where I sometimes rant about C++ or other topics.

If you would like to thank me for the Open Source work I do, please donate by buying me a [Ko-Fi][4] or send me a [donation on PayPal][5]. Your contribution is greatly appreciated and will encourage me to continue writing and developing.

If you want to contact me, you can find me on twitter [@janwilmans][6] or email me directly using my name and adding @gmail.com
