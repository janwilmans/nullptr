## [Debugview++][1]

![Debugview++][2]

Use debugview++ to collect, view and filter your application logs and boost your productivity in the process. Debugview++ was insprired by Sysinternals’s dbgview but has many expert features added, such as more log sources, advanced filtering using regular expressions and linked views. These allow you to more quickly analyse you logs. It is available free of charge, [download it directly from github][1].

Then there is the [nowind interface][11] which is a piece of hardware that connects the MSX computer to a modern host PC over a USB 2.0 connection.

## [x86-to-z80][15]

![x86-to-z80 example][16]

C++17 for MSX, sounds to good to be true? well, it is... but maybe not for long. x86-to-z80 aims to bring C++17 to the MSX platform, read more this on the github page. I'm having trouble finding the time to work on this; would you like to help implement it? Contact me using the form on the home page.
